Create new skins for Elementor PRO 3.x page builder. Design your own skins for Post and Post Archive Widgets using Elementor Loop Templates. Free post grid for Elementor.

== Description ==

This plugin adds new skin to Elementor Page Builder Posts and Posts Archive widget.

You can design a loop item just like a single template and it would be used as a skin so you can be able to create a post grid the way you like.

Working on a major release!!! A new widget will be available that would increase the flexibility of loop creation.  

All you have to do is to create a Custom Grid Template and place the Post Item Widget (placeholder) in your template made with sections and columns, and why not other widgets.
